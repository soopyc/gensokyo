This directory holds per-user configurations.

Note that files in `./home/` directories are **not** NixOS modules, rather
[Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) modules. You can
see the available options [in the HM manual](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/options.xhtml)
or with the [option searcher](https://home-manager-options.extranix.com/).
