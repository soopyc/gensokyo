# Hydra Setup

## Config options

## Remote builds
Remote building is very flaky at the moment. We did not get that to work properly unfortunately.

For a list of commits we have done to try and fix stuff, see `316fbcaabc3aaecec54e6872595de0789400169e...c66a3ce05ea022bae013eba77a0334bb62523a4c` on the repo.

Remote builds are still broken at the moment and we still have no idea why.
