# server code of conduct

this server code of conduct (this document) lays out what you can and cannot do, among other things, while playing on the server `mc.soopy.moe`.
by proceeding, you accept and agree to follow this document in full.

if you do not agree, you must not click the button below to gain access.

we don't like legalese either, so we will try to keep this as short as possible.
please note that while this is **not** a legally binding document, you are still subject to punishments for violating this code of conduct.

## explicitly allowed actions

we are hosting this minecraft server out of goodwill, so we also expect players to act in good faith. most things that are socially acceptable are also acceptable on this server. in addition, these things are explicitly permitted on the server.

- not indemnifying this server, server owners and server staff
  - this means you can talk shit about the admins.
- defaming human rights violators (including but not limited to trump, j.k. rowling and unnamed middle-east genocidic president) in an acceptable frequency and amount (so as to not affect other players)
- share derogatory memes **only about** shit world leaders and shit corporations
- be brilliant to each other

if the thing you plan to do doesn't make the life of other players difficult (regardless of it being in-game or not), you are likely permitted to do said thing.

## disallowed actions

you are not allowed to do anything in the following list, unless explicitly permitted by server admins in a gpg or ssh-signed message.

1. entice hate or violence against anyone regardless of their identity, status, anything.
2. partake in any form of bullying
3. vandalize, destroy or cause any form of damage against structures built by players without their permission
   - we don't mind if you bomb your own buildings or machines, but if even just one player does not want a specific thing to be destroyed, then you will not destroy said thing.
4. perform denial of service against the server by any means, including but not limited to in-game actions (e.g. redstone, tnt, etc.) or external actions (e.g. ping spam, SYN flooding, etc.)
   - actions that cause a denial of service is defined as anything that reduces the server TPS below 15 for more than 30 minutes, or outright crashing the server.
   - we have a system tracking lag spikes. please do not think you can get away with making a lag machine.
5. failing to cease any action after being asked to stop.
   - including but not limited to: (repeatedly) killing players, sending insufferable messages, etc.

note that this list may (or may not!) be modified with additional items from time to time depending on how poorly (or decently) players act.

## moderative actions

violating any of the rules set forth above may result in the following actions.

- **temporary** removal from the server (tempban; ranging from 1 hour to 30 days)
- **permanent** removal from the server **for this season** (permban for one season)
- **permanent** removal from the server **forever** (permban)

note that this list is not exhaustive, but we hope we never have to do anything not listed here.

there is **<span style="font-size: 2em">no</span>** appeal process. you really have to be a prick to get banned.

## reserved rights

admins and moderators reserves the right to the following:

- modifying any section of this code of conduct at anytime
