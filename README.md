# NixOS Configuration
This is a bare minimum nix configuration for koumakan.

I'm still very, very new to Nix and its ecosystem so pointers to better
way of doing things are very much appreciated.

## Note to self
* try to keep it simple as much as possible

## TODO
- [ ] migrate ~/.yubico/authorized_yubikeys to HM config (via pam.yubico.authorizedYubiKeys.ids)
